START BY REFERENCING AND MATCHING THE ATTACHED FILE AS THE BASELINE DESIGN AND BEHAVIOR. THEN APPLY THE FOLLOWING CHANGES ONLY:

UPDATE THE “READ FULL DISCLOSURE” SECTION UI BEHAVIOR AND VISUAL STATE AS FOLLOWS:

Before interaction (collapsed state):
• The “Read full disclosure” text must appear visually recessed and partially hidden, as if the content is positioned behind the dropdown/chevron arrow.
• Only the “Read full disclosure” label should be clearly readable.
• The disclosure content below it should be subtly visible but clipped, creating a layered effect (e.g., content masked by the container with overflow hidden).
• Use a soft gradient fade or shadow at the bottom of the collapsed container to indicate hidden content underneath.
• The dropdown arrow (chevron) should visually sit above the hidden content layer, reinforcing that content exists behind it.
• Cursor interaction should clearly indicate the area is expandable.

On click (expanded state):
• The dropdown arrow should animate smoothly (rotate or flip).
• The container should expand downward to fully reveal the entire disclosure text with no truncation.
• Remove all masking, clipping, fade, or overflow restrictions when expanded.
• The expanded content must be fully readable and scroll-free.
• Replace the toggle label with:
  ^
  Collapse disclosure
• Display the “^ Collapse disclosure” control centered below the fully expanded disclosure content, matching the reference design.

Technical guidance:
• Use a container with fixed max-height and overflow: hidden in the collapsed state.
• Apply a gradient mask or pseudo-element overlay to suggest hidden content.
• Transition max-height and opacity for a smooth open/close animation.
• Ensure accessibility: keyboard navigable, ARIA-expanded toggled correctly, and no content is hidden from screen readers when expanded.

Do not change typography, font size, colors, or spacing outside of what is necessary to achieve the layered “content-behind-chevron” visual effect.
