### View Willow 360 Managed Portfolios disclosures

Investments made on your behalf in a Willow 360 Managed Portfolio are highly speculative and entail substantial risks, including the fact that such investments are illiquid and subject to significant restrictions on transferability and redemption and that all or a substantial amount of the principal invested may be lost. No amount of diversification can eliminate such risks. Investment strategies such as the ones offered for Managed Portfolios may not be suitable for all investors, and potential investors must make an independent assessment of the appropriateness of any investment in light of their own objectives and circumstances.

Willow Wealth Inc. is the direct owner ofWillow Asset Management LLC, which is an SEC-registered investment adviser that manages the Willow Wealth funds and provides investment advice to “retail investors” through “Willow 360 Managed Portfolios.”

Willow Wealth Inc. has an engagement with Atomic Brokerage LLC (“Atomic Brokerage”), a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA and SIPC, to bring you the opportunity to open a brokerage account. Brokerage services for customers ofWillow Wealth Inc.are provided by Atomic Brokerage. Custodial and clearing services are provided to Atomic Brokerage by Pershing LLC.

### View important footnotes related to performance, returns, duration, and other information about Willow Wealth investments

1 Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections may not reflect actual future performance. All securities involve risk and may result in significant losses.

3 "Annual interest," "Annualized Return" or "Target Returns" represents a projected annual target rate of interest or annualized target return, and not returns or interest actually obtained by fund investors. “Term" represents the estimated term of the investment; the term of the fund is generally at the discretion of the fund’s manager, and may exceed the estimated term by a significant amount of time. Unless otherwise specified on the fund's offering page, target interest or returns are based on an analysis performed by Willow Wealth of the potential inflows and outflows related to the transactions in which the strategy or fund has engaged and/or is anticipated to engage in over the estimated term of the fund. There is no guarantee that targeted interest or returns will be realized or achieved or that an investment will be successful. Actual performance may deviate from these expectations materially, including due to market or economic factors, portfolio management decisions, modelling error, or other reasons.

4 Reflects the annualized distribution rate that is calculated by taking the most recent quarterly distribution approved by the Fund's Board of Directors and dividing it by prior quarter-end NAV and annualizing it. The Fund’s distribution may exceed its earnings. Therefore, a portion of the Fund’s distribution may be a return of the money you originally invested and represent a return of capital to you for tax purposes.

5 Represents the sum of the interest accrued in the statement period plus the interest paid in the statement period.

6 The internal rate of return ("IRR") represents an average net realized IRR with respect to all matured investments, excluding our Short Term Notes and Structured Notes programs, weighted by the investment size of each individual investment, made by private investment vehicles managed byWillow Asset Management LLCfrom July 1, 2015 through and including March 31, 2025, after deduction of management fees and all other expenses charged to investments.
