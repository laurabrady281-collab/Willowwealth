PARTNER LOGOS SECTION REQUIREMENTS:

For the section titled “A SELECTION OF OUR PARTNERS”:

1. Continuous Infinite Scrolling (LEFT → RIGHT)
- Partner logos must scroll horizontally from LEFT TO RIGHT in a smooth, continuous, infinite loop.
- When a logo exits the screen on the right side, it must immediately reappear from the left side with no delay, jump, or empty space.
- The scrolling must be seamless and uninterrupted (marquee-style animation).
- Animation must begin automatically on page load.

2. Scroll Behavior & Smoothness
- Scroll speed should be smooth, consistent, and readable.
- No stuttering, freezing, or resetting at loop points.
- Animation must remain fluid across all browsers and devices.

3. Image Enhancement & Visual Strength
- Strongly enhance all partner logos so they appear:
  - Crisp and sharp
  - High-resolution
  - Bold and clearly visible
- Increase contrast and clarity so logos stand out clearly.
- Logos must NOT appear faded, greyed out, blurry, or low-opacity.
- Preserve original brand colors accurately.
- Logos should visually “pop” against the background.

4. Size & Spacing
- Slightly increase logo size for better readability.
- Maintain even spacing between logos.
- Do not stretch or distort logo aspect ratios.

5. Responsiveness
- The scrolling logo section must be fully responsive and optimized for:
  - Mobile (iOS & Android)
  - Tablets
  - Laptops
  - Desktop screens
- Logos should scale proportionally while remaining readable on all screen sizes.
- Performance must remain smooth on low-end mobile devices.

6. Interaction Rules
- No hover effects that pause, dim, or stop the animation.
- Scrolling must continue even while the user scrolls the page.

IMPORTANT:
Do not redesign the layout.
Do not change the section structure or heading.
Only apply continuous left-to-right scrolling and visual enhancement.
The final output must look exactly like the attached screenshots and images, but with improved motion and clarity.
